# Feature 2003: Dynamic Budget Configuration Forms

**Description**: When users select different budgeting models, the configuration form dynamically updates to show only relevant input fields and options specific to that model.

**Stories**:
- Story 2003-0001: As a user, I want the budget form to change based on my selected model.
- Story 2003-0002: As a user, I want to see model-specific configuration options.
- Story 2003-0003: As a user, I want conditional fields to appear when required by the model.
- Story 2003-0004: As a user, I want form validation rules to change based on the selected model.
- Story 2003-0005: As a user, I want to preview how my selections affect the budget before saving.

**Solution**:
- Implement dynamic form rendering based on model selection
- Create model-specific field configurations
- Add conditional logic for showing/hiding form sections
- Integrate real-time validation based on model requirements
- Add budget preview functionality with live calculations
